MHD simulation by DsP v.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1/2-alpha
Currently implemented algorithm :
a) at first we create a 2d vector, we can scale it by parameter a
b) we use it to create a set of parallel vectors with different magnitudes
c) we rotate the whole set in order to create a disk (we also can do it by rotation matrix)
d) now we project stereographicly to create a spherical front

Install: 
get a scheme distro for your system (pref chicken scheme).
have gnuplot installed to view data output.
will soon provide a makefile ;)
