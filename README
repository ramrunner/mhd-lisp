MHD simulation by DsP v.03-alpha

spherical front simulation:
  Currently implemented algorithm :
  a) at first we create a 2d vector, we can scale it by parameter a
  b) we use it to create a set of parallel vectors with different magnitudes
  c) we rotate the whole set in order to create a disk (we also can do it by rotation matrix)
  d) now we project stereographicly to create a spherical front

On the Sagdeev 1d plasma simulation technique:
  We implement a safe Newton Raphson method to calculate the zeros of the S(phi, M) potential
  then using a discrete scheme based on the second derivative of phi with respect to X we
  calculate Phi as function of X

  Todo:
    Use the Phi(X) functions as initials conditions on a multigrid solver to test the stability
    of those pulses.

Install: 
get a scheme distro for your system (pref chicken scheme).
have gnuplot installed to view data output.
will soon provide a makefile ;)
